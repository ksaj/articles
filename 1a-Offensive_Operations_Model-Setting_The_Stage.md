# Setting the Stage

* NOTE: This is a rough draught of an introductory article that will be published on the www.PENETRATIONTEST.com website. It is provided in this form for review purposes only. It is part of approximately 40 articles currently being edited for inclusion on the www.PENETRATIONTEST.com website over the next few weeks. It is a very large project that the author has spent countless hours on, so please don't ruin it by disrespecting the copyright.

Imagine a game of Chess. You have two primary goals. To fight a winning campaign, you aim to capture your opponent’s king by cornering him in such a way that no further evasive move is possible. *Checkmate.* 

Yet at the same time, you must strive to demonstrate your own cunning by employing a superior sense of observation and tactical skill to ensure your own king does not fall to your opponent first. Each move you make is carefully planned to systematically bring you closer to the enemy, while keeping your own losses to a minimum. Game rules specify how each man can move, forcing you to fight both with and against a set of well established and distinct limitations.

A pawn, a singular member of the most highly available type of chess piece on the board, is limited to a particular set of moves that differ in significant ways compared to the bishop, or the rook, or the knight. Pawns are by definition the first most likely to die early in the game, as their duty is generally to protect the more powerful men as they move around the board. 

The Queen, initially forced to hide idly and perhaps even powerlessly behind an army of expendible pawns, flanked by the eminent yet vulnerable King and a nearby bishop, is suddenly set free by a single strategic move made by a (sometimes sacrificial) pawn, instantly gaining substantially more power and control than any other piece on the board. 

The strangest and most complex chess character is the bold and daring knight, who by armored steed is the only fighter given the ability to leap over other men regardless of colour and creed, and who is often forced to run in circles in a sort of holding pattern before landing on his strategic target. 

The game consists of many complex and potentially incompatible layers of differing strategies all tightly focused on just one ultimate goal - the opposing king's quick demise.

And possibly the most important aspect in this conflict - you *must* think as both the defender and the offender at all times if you were to hope for any chance of success in winning the game.

In some sense the world on a chessboard is a simple one: The wager is clearly defined. The rules of engagement are equally perspicuous to either opposing parties. Everyone playing the game knows what to expect both from themselves and their opponent.

When real-world military engagement is a real possibility, much more is at stake. The scope of enemies and their particular strategies vary considerably, and is far less well defined by chess-like game limitations. Real assets are at stake. Rules will probably be broken. Lies will be told. Reputations and allegiances will be stressed. Collateral damage will be left behind. 

Real war is messy. 

So to face the threat, armies stage war games well before any struggle actually breaks out. This is demonstrated yearly as the United States and South Korea engage in war games in preparation for potential aggression from the North. Even more of the strategy can be witnessed today with Donald Trump and Kim Jong Il's seemingly mutual focus of ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons and an eventual declaration of the official end to the decades-long Korean War.

Even dispite a considerably different level of urgency, one can still see how these war games are a lot like playing chess – the game is split evenly by “good guys” and “bad guys” who cooperate in order to hone their respective performance capabilities, and to detect their own tactical flaws so they can be remedied before deployment in an actual theatre of war. 

Of course, in war games damage is purposely kept to a minimum, but they entail a necessarily accurate portrayal.

Through practice and continued testing, soldiers become incrementally prepared for the real thing. Their defenses are stronger because they have already detected and mitigated their own weaknesses before the enemy gets a chance to exploit them. They understand what assets they need to protect. The groundwork is in place to ensure any engagement is conducted efficiently and consistently. All the players are playing the same game.

In this series, we will be setting the stage for cyber warfare in order to fully understand how it plays with information assets. In the next installment we will cover the actual costs associated to real-world attacks, cyber or otherwise. Only once we qualify and quantify what we need to protect can we begin to understand the mindset of those who would target it. It is this mind we must assume when conducting penetration test exercises against friendly assets. Here we see the need for game play rules, and conduct the business affairs that lead to a successful engagement, and continuing survival as each engagement concludes.
